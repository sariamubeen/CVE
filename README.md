## Understanding CVEs

### What is a CVE?
A CVE, or Common Vulnerability and Exposure, is a standardized identifier assigned to a security vulnerability. The CVE system aims to provide a common language for discussing and sharing information about security issues.

### Importance of CVEs
1. **Security Planning:** Understanding CVEs helps organizations plan and implement effective security measures.
2. **Incident Response:** Quick access to CVE information facilitates faster and more informed incident response.
3. **Risk Management:** CVEs play a crucial role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.
4. **Vendor and Developer Communication:** CVEs provide a standardized way to communicate security issues between vendors, developers, and the wider community.
